# mini-java-compiler
This is a mini java compiler.
Just download and run this in visual studio. 

You should load a file in java syntex and then when you push the buttom to create a file, it creates a file called "Codigo.out" in a carpet called "Resultado" in the desktop. This file show you what tokens it recognize and the lexical errors.

# mini-java-compiler
This is a mini java compiler.
Just download and run this in visual studio. 

You should load a file in java syntex and then when you push the buttom to create a file, it creates a file called "Codigo.out" in a carpet called "Resultado" in the desktop. This file show you what tokens it recognize and the lexical errors. 

LR1 was used to analyze the entered grammar. The parser, when finding errors, takes them and saves them in an error handling variable and drags them to the end of the process and then displays them on the screen, as requested in the project statement.
